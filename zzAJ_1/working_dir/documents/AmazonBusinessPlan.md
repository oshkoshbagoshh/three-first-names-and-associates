Business Proposal for the Amazon Influencer Program  
Overview: Our Amazon Influencer Program partners with influencers to create engaging, high-conversion content for Amazon products. Leveraging advanced product research software, we streamline the process of finding, reviewing, and promoting products. This program ensures influencers maximize earnings while reducing the workload typically associated with product selection, scriptwriting, and promotional strategies.  
Key Features:

* Advanced Product Research: Our software identifies top-performing products based on sales metrics, competition, and video presence.  
* Automated Workflow: From product research to affiliate article generation, every step is automated, reducing manual effort.  
* Collaborative Opportunities: Influencers collaborate within a structured ecosystem, including shared reviews and referrals.  
* Revenue Sharing: A clear and attractive commission structure incentivizes sales, content creation, and program referrals.

Goals:

* Empower influencers to earn consistent income through Amazon affiliate sales.  
* Establish a scalable, automated system for product research and content creation.  
* Foster a community-driven referral program to expand reach and influence.

Benefits of the Program

* Efficiency Through Systematization:  
* The program minimizes the time and effort required to create and post videos. By employing an assembly-line approach, tasks are broken into manageable pieces, with product research, scriptwriting, and promotions handled collaboratively and systematically. This reduces the workload on individual influencers while maximizing output.  
* Ongoing Revenue Potential:  
* Unlike many forms of work that generate one-time income, every video created in this program has the potential to earn money indefinitely. Whether through affiliate commissions or product sales, influencers continue to benefit long after the initial video is completed.  
* Low-Risk Product Engagement:  
* By incorporating the option to return unsold products, influencers face minimal financial risk. This approach ensures influencers can focus on creating quality content without concerns about inventory loss.  
* Scalable Earnings:  
* The combination of individual video revenues, affiliate link earnings, and referral commissions offers influencers multiple streams of income, creating significant earning potential.

Process Flow  
Step 1: Influencer Registration

* Action: Influencers fill out the Bio Form [link to form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-veGIzxY_-JNvIiLdTZ8tRo_OOl1FNXjO7s85ucirutAgOg/viewform?usp=header).  
* Purpose: Gather details to personalize scripts and group influencers by product categories.  
* Output: Bio data is stored in the system for reference.

Step 2: Nightly Product Research

* Process:  
  * The system cycles through one category per group nightly.  
  * Conducts a search on Amazon (first 20 pages).  
  * Filters results based on price range, monthly sales, and video counts.  
  * Curates a list of the top 50 products based on a proprietary algorithm.  
* Output: An email with the curated list is sent to relevant influencers.

Step 3: Product Selection

* Influencer Action:  
  * Influencers research the emailed list and select products by clicking a green button in the email.  
  * Sends an automated notification to the AI system.  
* AI Action:  
  * Tracks product selection.  
  * Notifies other relevant influencers for potential collaboration.  
  * Begins generating a product description and script.  
* Output: Influencer receives the finalized script and product description via email.

Step 4: Product Review and Promotion

* Action: Influencers review and promote products:  
  * Post listings on platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist.  
  * Use original photos/screenshots (not Amazon images).  
* Timeframe: Attempt to sell the product within 29 days.  
* Return Policy: If unsold, influencers return the product and notify the system.

Step 5: Revenue Sharing

* Commission Breakdown for Product Sales:  
  * 70% to the original purchaser.  
  * 30% to the seller/poster.  
* Commission Breakdown for Articles:  
  * 60% to the reviewer (10% to script reader if applicable).  
  * 40% to technology/management.  
* Affiliate Links Commission:  
  * 20%/80% (tech-written articles).  
  * 60%/40% (individually written articles).

Step 6: Article Generation and Posting

* System Action:  
  * Generates an article using the product script and influencer bio.  
  * Posts the article on the website with affiliate links.  
* Influencer Action: Upload the product thumbnail for system processing.

Step 7: Referral Program

* Incentive: Influencers earn 10% of commissions from referred influencers.  
* Process:  
  * Search Instagram for potential recruits via product video carousels.  
  * Use templates to message up to 50 influencers daily.

Video Carousel Monitoring  
To ensure the longevity and effectiveness of each video:

* The software will periodically check to ensure that influencer videos remain on the main video carousel for the associated product.  
* If a video is removed from the carousel, the system will:  
  * Send an email alert to the original poster.  
  * Provide instructions for reposting the video to restore visibility.

This added feature ensures videos continue generating affiliate revenue and maximizing their earning potential.  
Scalability  
This program is designed to scale by:

* Automating repetitive tasks like product research, scripting, and article posting.  
* Incentivizing influencer referrals to grow the team.  
* Diversifying promotional strategies through multiple sales channels.

Conclusion:  
This proposal outlines a robust, scalable, and efficient partnership model, combining influencer creativity with advanced software to maximize revenue potential. The systemâ€™s automation and monitoring features allow influencers to focus on creativity and collaboration, ensuring continued growth and success.
